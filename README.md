## Installation Guide

To get started with Vulkan, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go**: [Download and install Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- **Docker**: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the Vulkan repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/p-society/vulkan.git
   cd vulkan
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

    Use `make` to build the Vulkan executable:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. **Run**

    Execute Vulkan with the desired GitHub repository URL:

    ```bash
    ./vulkan <github-url>
    ```
    Example:

    ```bash
    ./vulkan https://github.com/majorbruteforce/http-starter.git
    ```

### Troubleshooting

- Permission Denied for Docker: Ensure your user is added to the docker group. Refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) for instructions on adding your user to the docker group.

- Missing Dependencies: Make sure both Go and Docker are installed and accessible from your command line. Verify installation by running go version and docker --version.
